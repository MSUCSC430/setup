# Course Setup

First, you will need to create a Github account using your murraystate email (also, please make your user name the same as your MSU user name. If you already have an account with your MSU email, just notify me of what user name is associated with your account). After you create an account, notify me so that I can add you to the MurrayStateCSC430 organization and give you permission to access the assignments.

Once you have access to the organization, you should go to magnum.travis-ci.com and try to sign in with your github account. **DO NOT PAY MONEY FOR THIS** you should be recognized as a student account and be given free access. If this does not work, let me know! (**Note**: An early adopter had some problems with this and was able to get a free trial, but not an education account. I contacted the support team and they informed me that students have to get the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) in order for their accounts to be registered as educational accounts; simply being part of my organization is not sufficient. I don't know how long that takes, but the free trial should last long enough for this to go through).

In order to work on these assignments, you will need to make sure that your system can properly use Maven, Java and Git. If you use an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, then you will be able to easily get plugins (if they're not already installed) to provide proper Git and Maven functionality within your IDE. Please consult the internet about how to make sure you can configure your IDE for use with Git and Maven! You are also free to use command line tools if you prefer to go that route.

Once you have all of the above completed, you will need to fork assignments so that you have your own (**private**) repository and then implement the solution to the assignment. You will be able to use Travis to make sure that what you have committed is building and testing properly so there won't be any surprises when you're graded.

## Note About Academic Honesty

You should keep your code and repositories private and should not be sharing code under any circumstances. Also, when forking your projects, you should make sure the repository is set to *private* and you should immediately remove the classes team *AllThePeople* from your project so that I will be the only person who can access your code other than you! If you do not do this and check in large amounts of code, I will consider this a violation of the academic honesty policies of MSU.
