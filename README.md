# Course Setup

First, you will need to create a Github account using your murraystate email (also, please make your user name the same as your MSU user name. If you already have an account with your MSU email, just notify me of what user name is associated with your account). After you create an account, notify me so that I can add you to the MurrayStateCSC430 organization and give you permission to access the assignments.

Once you have access to the organization, you should go to magnum.travis-ci.com and try to sign in with your github account. **DO NOT PAY MONEY FOR THIS** you should be recognized as a student account and be given free access. If this does not work, let me know!

In order to work on these assignments, you will need to make sure that your system can properly use Maven, Java and Git. If you use an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, then you will be able to easily get plugins (if they're not already installed) to provide proper Git and Maven functionality within your IDE. Please consult the internet about how to make sure you can configure your IDE for use with Git and Maven! You are also free to use command line tools if you prefer to go that route.

Once you have all of the above completed, you will need to fork assignments so that you have your own (**private**) repository and then implement the solution to the assignment. You will be able to use Travis to make sure that what you have committed is building and testing properly so there won't be any surprises when you're graded.
